## Introduction to AngularDart

### About Dart
- programming language
- familiar to java/c# devs
- not verbose

#### Cool Stuff
- Supports string interpolation
- String interpolation works also with classes
- Constructors with less repetition
    Person(this.name, this.county, this.age)); // example constructor

- Named constructors
- Factory pattern for constructors
- cascades
	.. operator
	references last object
- if null operators
- first class functions; reasonable clojures
- Async
	- async and await keywords
	- Future and Stream are the main classes
