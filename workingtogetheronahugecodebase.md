# Working together on a huge codebase 

## Table of Contents


## Size
- 3 billion lines of code
- 75k commits by humans
- approx. 250k commits by automated tools

## Constraints

### Monolithic Model
- trunk based development
- branches for releases

### Advantages
- avoid dependency hell
- everybody has all the code

### Tools
- piper: The repository; chrome, google drive, etc. Everything is there.
	- sync changes
	- write code
	- code review
	- commit
- tool based code review
- clients in the cloud
	The whole workspace of every developer is cloud based
	- code analysis
	- editing
	- collaborating
- explore
	searching and navigating through the code is also cloud base
	- searching for reg-ex-patterns, class names, etc. 
	- ctrl + click etc. works as expected
